## Rust discord bot
If you want a version of the bot hosted by me, you can use [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=687981060343988254&permissions=402712646&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgamerparty.eu&scope=bot) to invite it to your server

#### How to run the bot: 
* 0. You need to install `libopus-dev`, `ffmpeg` und `youtube-dl`
* 1. place your token in `external/token/token` 
* 2. use `cargo run --release` or `cargo build --release` to run or compile the bot.
 

#### TODO List:
 * Mod shit:
    * Make unban useable
    * Make the mute command create a "muted" role if it does't exist

 * Music shit:
    * Websdl support
