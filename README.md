## Rust discord bot
If you want a version of the bot hosted by me, you can use [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=687981060343988254&permissions=402712646&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgamerparty.eu&scope=bot) to invite it to your server

Rewriting the bot with twilight-rs instead.
