The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isnt. By subtracting where it is from where it isnt, or where it isnt from where it is (whichever is greater), it
obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isnt, and arriving at a position where it w
asnt, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasnt, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isnt. In the event that the position that it is in is no
t the position that it wasnt, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasnt. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be c
orrected by the GEA.
